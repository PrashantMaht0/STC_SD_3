Third Project for Internship under skillCraft Technology


This Java program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for solving Sudoku puzzles using the Swing library. 
It features a 9x9 grid where users can manually input numbers. 
The GUI includes a control panel with number buttons (0-9), a "Back" button to clear the selected cell, an "All Clear" button to reset the grid, a "Solve" button to solve the puzzle, and a "Rules" button to display Sudoku rules. 
Users can select a cell and input numbers through the control panel.
The program validates the initial input and solves the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm, 
displaying the solution on the grid or showing an error message if no solution exists.
